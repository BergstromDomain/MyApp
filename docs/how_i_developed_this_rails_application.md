# How I developed this Ruby on Rails application #
> I was first introduced to *Ruby on Rails* in 2008 when I worked at Tilgin. We developed a test automation framework based on Ruby on Rails combining Ruby-, Bash- and PHP-scripts and as well as test specifications and reports written in LaTeX. I realised that this was a very useful framework and that I would use this for my own apps at some point.
>
> Since then, I have taken some online courses and I have had a few attempts of developing my own apps. None of them have been matured enough to be deployed.
>
> In this blog series, I've documented the steps I took when I developed and deployed my first app. This blog series was written mostly for myself in order to learn how to develop Rails and to have a reference guide. I decided to document most of my development activities, including the version control handling.
> 
> I have created multiple appendix sections which I plan to populate with additional development details and deep dives as I go along.
